# DFA Implementation in Python - Detailed Features

This Python implementation of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) offers a variety of functionalities for analyzing and manipulating DFAs. Below is a detailed explanation of the features and the underlying logic of each method in the `Dfa` class.

## Features

### Initialization

- **Constructor `__init__(self, states, alphabet, transitions, start_state, accept_states)`**: Initializes the DFA with a set of states, alphabet, transition function, start state, and accept states.
  - `states`: A list of states in the DFA.
  - `alphabet`: A list of symbols constituting the DFA's alphabet.
  - `transitions`: A dictionary representing the transition function, mapping tuples of (state, symbol) to resulting states.
  - `start_state`: The starting state of the DFA.
  - `accept_states`: A list of accept states.

### Language Checks

- **`is_empty_language(self)`**: Determines if the language accepted by the DFA is empty.
  - Logic: If there are no accept states or no path from the start state to any of the accept states exists, the language is empty.

- **`is_finite(self)`**: Checks whether the language of the DFA is finite.
  - Logic: After minimizing the DFA, it checks for cycles that involve an accept state. If such a cycle exists, the language is infinite; otherwise, it is finite.

### String Acceptance

- **`accepts_string(self, input_string)`**: Checks whether the DFA accepts a given string.
  - Logic: Starts from the initial state and makes transitions based on the input string. If it ends in an accept state, the string is accepted.

### DFA Minimization

- **`minimize(self)`**: Minimizes the DFA to its simplest form.
  - Logic: Removes unreachable states and merges equivalent states. The algorithm first marks distinct pairs of states (accepting and non-accepting) and then repeatedly marks pairs that lead to already marked pairs under any symbol of the alphabet.

### Additional Features

- **`is_trap(self, state)`**: Checks if a state is a trap state (a state from which no exit is possible).
  - Logic: A state is a trap if all transitions from that state lead back to itself.

- **`all_strings(self)`**: Generates all strings accepted by the DFA if its language is finite.
  - Logic: Uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the DFA from the start state, collecting strings that lead to accept states. It terminates paths upon reaching trap states or looping back.

- **`are_equivalent(self, other_dfa)`**: Checks if two DFAs are equivalent (accept the same language).
  - Logic: Compares the states and transitions of the two DFAs to see if they behave identically for all inputs.



# Regular Expression Analyzer

The `RegularExpressionAnalyzer` class is designed to analyze and process regular expressions. It includes methods for checking if an expression is regular, converting a regular expression to a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), then to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), and comparing languages represented by regular expressions. Below is an overview of the class and its methods.

## Class Overview

The class contains the following methods:

- `__init__()`: Initializes the RegularExpressionAnalyzer object.
- `is_regular(expression)`: Determines if a given expression is a regular expression.
- `to_nfa(expression)`: Converts a regular expression to an NFA.
- `to_dfa(expression)`: Converts a regular expression to a DFA.
- `compare_languages(expression1, expression2)`: Compares the languages of two regular expressions.
- `is_relation(expression1, expression2)`: Checks if there is a subset relation between the languages of two regular expressions.
- `is_subset(expression1, expression2)`: Checks if the language of one regular expression is a subset of another.

## Method Details

### `is_regular(expression)`
- **Purpose**: Determines whether the given expression is a valid regular expression.
- **Logic**: 
  - Validates the expression syntax using a stack for parenthesis matching and operator placement checking.
  - Checks if all symbols are valid (operators, alphabets, empty and epsilon symbols).
  - Converts the expression to an NFA and checks if the conversion is successful.

### `to_nfa(expression)`
- **Purpose**: Converts a regular expression to an NFA.
- **Logic**:
  - Converts the infix regular expression to postfix using the Shunting-yard algorithm for easier processing.
  - Processes each character in the postfix expression, constructing the NFA step by step:
    - For alphabets and special symbols ('∅', 'ε'), create simple NFAs.
    - For operators ('|', '*', '+', '.'), merge or modify existing NFAs on the stack according to the operator rules.
  - Returns the final NFA from the stack.

### `to_dfa(expression)`
- **Purpose**: Converts a regular expression to a DFA.
- **Logic**:
  - First converts the regular expression to an NFA.
  - Constructs the DFA using the subset construction method:
    - Computes ε-closures for NFA states.
    - Creates DFA states as sets of NFA states and determines transitions based on the NFA's transitions.
  - Determines the start state and accept states for the DFA based on the NFA's states.
  - Returns the constructed DFA.

### `compare_languages(expression1, expression2)`
- **Purpose**: Compares the languages represented by two regular expressions.
- **Logic**:
  - Converts each expression to its equivalent DFA.
  - Compares the DFAs to determine if they represent the same language.

### `is_relation(expression1, expression2)`
- **Purpose**: Checks if there is a subset relation between the languages of two regular expressions.
- **Logic**:
  - Utilizes `is_subset` method to check if one language is a subset of the other in either direction.

### `is_subset(expression1, expression2)`
- **Purpose**: Checks if the language of one regular expression is a subset of the other.
- **Logic**:
  - Converts both expressions to DFAs.
  - Checks if all strings accepted by the first DFA are also accepted by the second DFA.

## Additional Classes: `DFA` and `NFA`
- The `DFA` and `NFA` classes are used for representing deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, respectively. They contain states, an alphabet, transition functions, a start state, and accept states.

By providing these functionalities, the `RegularExpressionAnalyzer` class serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing and processing regular expressions, allowing for the comparison and conversion between different forms of automata representations.






# Degree of Regular Expression

The `Degree` class is designed to calculate the degree of a given regular expression. The degree of a regular expression is a concept used to determine the complexity or nesting level of operations within the expression. Below is an overview of the class and its method.

## Class Overview

The class contains the following method:

- `__init__(regular_expression)`: Initializes the Degree object with a regular expression.
- `get_degree()`: Calculates the degree of the regular expression.

## Method Details

### `__init__(regular_expression)`
- **Purpose**: Initializes a new instance of the Degree class with the provided regular expression.
- **Parameters**:
  - `regular_expression`: A string representing the regular expression.

### `get_degree()`
- **Purpose**: Calculates the degree of the regular expression.
- **Logic**:
  - **Base Cases**:
    - If the regular expression is an empty string (`''`), its degree is 0.
    - If the regular expression is a single alphabet character or the lambda symbol (`λ`), its degree is 0.
  - **Kleene Star (`*`) Case**:
    - If the last character of the expression is a Kleene star (`*`), the function calls itself recursively with the expression excluding the star.
    - If the inner expression's degree is not infinity, the degree of the whole expression is the inner degree plus 1.
  - **Union (`+`) Case**:
    - If the expression contains a union operator (`+`), the expression is split into its constituent parts.
    - The function is called recursively for each part, and the maximum degree among these parts is computed.
    - This approach calculates the highest degree of complexity present in any part of the union.
  - **Default Case**:
    - If none of the above cases apply, the function returns infinity, indicating an undefined or infinitely complex expression.

This method effectively handles different components of regular expressions, including empty strings, single characters, Kleene star operations, and unions, to compute the degree of complexity of the regular expression. It recursively breaks down the expression into simpler parts and calculates the degree based on the complexity of its operations.
